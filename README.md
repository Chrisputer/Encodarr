Introducing the Automated Library Encoder in its Pre-Alpha stage. This application aims to automatically convert your non-x265 and non-vp9 encoded media to either x265 or vp9, without requiring additional user input. It will replace or add to your media library, and can send API calls to PVRs for updating, renaming, and modifying show/movie settings.

Why do we need this? The goal is to reduce storage costs and enable high-quality streaming over the WAN. When the creator of this app is on the road, they rely heavily on streaming over WAN, and they also share their Plex server with friends and family. With only 20mbps upload, they were having trouble getting good quality video to stream. They already have a working solution via Handbrake-CLI and PowerShell, which they will share shortly, but they want to improve their Python skills and have extra time on their hands.

The initial release of this app will support x264, x265, and VP9 codecs, but the creator has no plans to support AV1 yet due to its experimental nature. Hardware acceleration will be included where possible. For example, VP9 HW Encoding is only supported on Intel Quick Sync with Kaby Lake or newer hardware, running on a specially built Ubuntu 18.04 OS. The creator still believes this is the best codec to use, but they are looking for suggestions on how to make it accessible to everyone, possibly through a container with a webGUI front-end. x264 and x265 HW acceleration works pretty much everywhere.

For reference, the creator uses a 7700K and uses QSV x265 Main10 @ 4mbps, which looks like a 12mbps x264 stream and encodes at around 70fps. These x265 encodes work extremely well on devices that can direct stream/play over the WAN.
